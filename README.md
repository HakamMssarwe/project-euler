# project-euler

Solution to the first 9 problems on Project Euler (if you don't count the first one)

[Project Euler Archieved Problems Link](https://projecteuler.net/archives)


## What I learned

lots of math and faster algorithms (the name of them can be found in the project, each visual studio solution was named after the problem that was being solved)


## How did I solve them

I solved some problems quicker than other, some of them I had to watch math lectures and learn new algorithms.
